Chris Wilson:
  For my summer, I did a good amount of traveling. For the first half of my summer, I stayed with my mom's side of the family in Port St. John, Florida. As for the latter half of summer, I went north to stay at my grandparent's in Wanakena, New York, a small hamlet in the middle of the Adirondack Mountains. For the most part, I spent my time unwinding with family and exploring for myself.
